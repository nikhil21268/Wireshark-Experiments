# Wireshark Packet Captures Project

## Overview
This project involves a detailed analysis of wireless network parameters such as signal strength, bit rate, transmission power, and frequency bands. The primary objective is to understand how these parameters vary with changes in the environment and device configurations.

## Features
- **Real-time Signal Tracking**: Automated script to measure and log wireless network parameters in real-time while moving.
- **Dynamic Analysis**: Detailed examination of how signal strength and bit rate vary with mobility.
- **Network Configuration**: Setup and analysis of a network with one access point and two clients to evaluate the network performance under different configurations.
- **Packet Analysis**: Deep packet inspection to analyze the types of frames exchanged and their respective bit rates and signal strengths.

## Results
The results are plotted and analyzed to show how wireless network parameters are impacted by physical distance and obstacles. The analysis covers:
- Variations of signal strength and bit rate while moving.
- Impact of device proximity on network performance in a controlled environment setup.
